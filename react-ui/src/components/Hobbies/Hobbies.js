                I prefer going for small treks to take a break from work and the daily routine. I have completed various treks in the Western ghats/Sahyadri region like Torna, Rajmachi, Sudhagad, Korigad, Kalsubai, Vikat Gad, Mahuli Gad, Visapur, Sihagad, Vasota jungle trek, Tung & Tikona,  Tadiandamol trek and the mighty Katraj to Sihagad night trek.

                <div className="mt-2 grey-1 body-text">
                 Since my childhood I was always passionate about drawing. I really enjoyed Art & Crafts classes in my school. I loved drawing Pokemon characters, cars and bikes. Later I was lost in the world of competition but still managed to keep my interest as we had engineering drawing, AutoCAD in the curriculum. Now I have started learning digital drawing. Please check my instagram profile  for some of my work.

                <div className="mt-2 grey-1 body-text">
                From the day I have bought the RE classic 350 I have developed this weird interest of going to places without any reason. I love riding my bike. I usually travel Mumbai - Pune on bike. The Most memorable bike trip would be Leh Ladakh - The stunning view, endless empty roads full of twist and turns.
